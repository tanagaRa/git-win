Don't kill me just help me run away
From everyone I need a place to stay.
Where I can cover up my face,
Don't cry I am just a freak,

I am just a freak,
I am just a freak,
I am just a freak.

My head is filled with parasites,
Black holes cover up my eyes,
I dream of you almost every night,
Hopefully I won't wake up this time,

I won't wake up this time,
I won't wake up this time,
I won't wake up this time.
